critical:
-Make sure one of the plots use seaborne (5 city line plot)
-Make sure data comes from a .sqlite file not a csv (figure out how to do this using sqlalchemy)
-correct plot labels
-correct headings in index.html
-Make sure both city and state is displayed in dropdown menus and plots
-Clean up the repo so it only contains files


optional:
-Make one of the plots interactive using plotly
-Have it built into the site that the data is directly taken from the web and imported into the database
-Change the look of the site
-Add cloud hosting
