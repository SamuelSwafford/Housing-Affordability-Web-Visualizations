critical:
-Modify bar_and_line_plot.py so that it takes a varriable and returns that varribale as a line plot
-Make sure both city and state is displayed
-Make sure one of the plots uses seaborne
-Make one of the plots interactive using plotly
-Make sure data comes from a .sqlite file not a csv (figure out how to do this using sqlalchemy)
-Clean up the repo so it only contains files


optional:
-Have it built into the site that the data is directly taken from the web and imported into the database
-Make the website sexier
    -Have the website start with a default page that users can modify by resubmitting the forum
